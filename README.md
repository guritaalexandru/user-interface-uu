The current project is a platform made for the clients and staff of The Flying Dutchman, a famous pub! It is developed to be available on multiple types of devices: desktops, tablets and phones!

Using this platform, the clients are able to see the menu, filter through it and create orders that they later pay at the bar. The user is able to drag and drop items from the menu into his order. He's also allowed to undo and redo his add / remove actions. They can also change the language of the application from English to Swedish or Chinese.

The staff can also use the application to log in and see the menu, edit stocks, see and manage the client's orders and notify the police or security in case of an emergency.
